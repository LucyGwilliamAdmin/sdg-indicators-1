The [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a set of ambitious goals and targets designed to make the world a better place by ending poverty, halting climate change and reducing inequalities. This work programme is part of the country’s commitment to the agenda 2030 on sustainable development.

Rwanda is strongly committed to ensuring that SDGs are understood and owned both at national and local levels and across stakeholders. The [Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning](http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/index.php?id=2) (MINECOFIN) is mandated to facilitate the ownership process at all levels of the national structures. NISR places huge importance on ensuring Rwanda's statistics are communicated clearly and concisely so that all data-users can easily access and understand them. 

The site is based on the open source ‘[Open SDG](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)’ platform. The Open SDG platform is the result of collaboaration between the US government, the UK Office For National Statistics (ONS), and the nonprofit Center For Open Data Enterprise (CODE). With the partnership of the ONS, [NISR](http://statistics.gov.rw/home) has chosen to report SDG indicators using the National Reporting Platform (NRP) as it is easily accessible, with automatically generated visualizations to show progress over time.
